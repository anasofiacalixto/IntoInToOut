# IntoInToOut

Repo for the interactive installation INTO IN TO OUT, developed for Goldsmiths University of London in partnership with Rafa Roeder

**In short**

Into In To Out is an installation that explores different forms of data visualisation and how to create loops between that and interactivity. The prompt was to research computation in relation to the body through a critical theoretical approach. Here, C++, Python and TouchDesigner were used. A teaser can be seen at: https://anasofiacalixto.com/research/into-in-to-out/

With this project, we followed our technical expectations: projections' range of colours changed with mapped emotions from a sensor worn by Ana Sofia, and changed movement with a sensor used by Rafa. Conceptually speaking, the research was a profound realisation that we had absolutely no control of this process whatsoever, letting go of ideals and reflecting on control and causality.
The first example happened while Ana Sofia had headphones on and was mapping the sensor's data, listening to a meditation to track “calm”, but got scared when someone entered the room. The range spiked from from a lower number to another which was before mapped as “angry”. 
In this episode, two key findings emerged: First, abstract thoughts and feelings are not easily traced, challenging the illusion of control over our emotions through external inputs. Secondly, one emotion is never one emotion. Our perception of humanity hopped from a conscious and sentient being to a patchwork of data and non processed feelings that emerge from external input.

When choosing the elements of the space, we wanted to add a material outcome, a physical element apart from ourselves and the technical apparatus, so we decided on confetti. During the experiments, the material looked like dozens of tiny screens falling on us, seeming as an extension of the screens, by reflecting the colours, and ourselves, by being multiplied extensions of our hands touching the other.

Our timeline was the following:
1. Place the confetti and camera;
2. Sit in front of each other;
3. Wear the sensors;
4. Look at each other and think: what do we do? What could we possibly talk about?

After different approaches to this moment, from small talk to children’s games, we stop whenever it feels like it should end. There’s no set time, no cues. Then, our anti-timeline begins:
1. Stop the camera;
2. Blow the confettis out of the table;
3. Talk about deeply personal stories, that came naturally in each pause;
4. Then, again: place the confetti. Look at each other. What could we possibly talk about?

It was a 12 hour process from the moment we started setting up the environment until we gathered the last confetti. And each time, in the moments of silence between scenes, we unintentionally created this space of looking at our own reflections on the multiplied screens, while picking them up one by one, and carefully placing them in suspension, only to let them cover us all over again. 

Eventually, the loop of translation was complete. Physical reactions translate into visuals, that are then seen by us, who watch this process and react to it once again, repeating the cycle. Moreover, we look at each other’s reaction, provoke each other with other physical elements that gently touch us, and we again watch each other's reaction to that. It’s an infinite cycle of kinesthetic empathy, an exercise of existing outside our own bodies and being trapped by elements born from within us.
